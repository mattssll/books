Chapter 04: The SOLID Principles
================================
Code examples for chapter 4.

All the commands here assume the presence of a virtual environment as described in the main section.

Run tests::

    make test


SOLID:
------
* Single Responsibility Principle: classes/methods should do one thing only if possible
* Open/Closed Principle: A client should be able to work with any subclass of a parent class (usually an interface)
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

LS has to do with polimorphism because diferent subclasses are poliphormic with the parent one.
